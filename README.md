## Run in release mode!
For better performance I recommend to run it in release mode

## Info
Space - enables / disables Spatial Hash Grid\
F - enables / disables Grid drawing

## Note

This is not the best implementation of it it can be optimized a lot lol, but for me it's enough

## How to build?

Clone repository and just run `build.bat` it will build for visual studio 2022 <br/>
If you want any older version run `.\vendor\premake5.exe vs2019` from main folder (works at least to vs17)
